Contents Drifting Flame As you enter the first room, you'll see a closed gate with an unlit upside-down ancient torch suspended to the left of it, and a lit ancient torch with a normal Torch on the ground to the right of it. Ignoring the torch on the ground, pull out your bow and walk over to the lit torch so that it lights your arrow on fire, and then shoot it at the upside torch to light it, opening the gate. You can also just fuse a Fire Fruit or Red Chuchu Jelly to your arrow and shoot the upside-down torch to light it that way. Climb the ladder, and you'll see a button on the floor with a fence on three sides of it, a large open platform behind it with three columns suspended over it, and a walkway to it's right that leads to the final closed gate. There is also a lit ancient torch that you can pick up with Ultrahand on that walkway. Standing on the button causes the open platform to drop down a good ways (roughly 20ft/6m), but also causes upside-down ancient torches to come down out of the bottom of the three suspended columns. You need to light the torches to open the final gate. Option 1:\\nPick up the lit ancient torch off of the walkway, run onto the platform and directly through the center of each square of sand underneath the three columns, and then quickly run back to the button and put down the torch. Once you step on the button, quickly use Recall on the lit ancient torch. If done correctly, the torch should move back to each column, lighting the upside-down torches and opening the gate. If trying to get all three lit in one shot is too difficult, it is possible to do the torches one at a time, as once an upside-down torch is lit, it will stay lit, even when it is no longer exposed. Option 2:\\nGrab the lit ancient torch with Ultrahand, and bring the torch over to the button. Now, while standing on the button, pull the torch right next to you so that it's on top of the pressed button as well, and hold it there for roughly 20 seconds. Now release the torch and step off of the button. Now use Recall on the torch, and it should activate the button, dropping the platform and torches down. Now just use arrows fused with Fire Fruit or Red Chuchu Jelly to light the torches before Recall runs out. The lone chest of this shrine (which contains a Construct Bow whose level depends on your world level) is in an alcove directly underneath the button in the second room. You can access this chest directly if you use Option 2 above (drop down to the platform after it drops), or you can jump off of the walkway next to the final gate and paraglide under the open platform and into the alcove.

The Shrine is located in the Gerudo Highlands on Rutimala Hill. Contents A Route for a Ball Once inside of the shrine, move down the ramp and make a left, noticing the large ball receptacle and the closed gate to the altar as you do so. To your left will be a large pit, with a pair of rails on the right side, and a pair of angled fans pointing up to the ledge above. Paraglide up to the ledge using the fans. Once on the ledge, straight ahead there will be a small pit (with floor) with a treasure chest on a ledge past it, to your right will be a higher ledge with a funnel-shaped chimney built into the face of it, and to your left will be an alcove with another ledge above it, this one holding a large ball. Use Ascend in the alcove to get up to the ledge, then grab the ball using Ultrahand and bring it down to the floor. To get up to the higher ledge on the right, use Ultrahand to place the large ball into the funnel-shaped section of the chimney, then stand underneath it and use Ascend to get on top of the ball, and jump onto the ledge. Up here you'll see our receptacle ball stuck in an endless loop of rolling down chutes and falling into the abyss. Once the ball reaches the second chute, hit the ball with Recall, and once it is over the gap between the chutes, deactivate Recall, causing the ball to fall onto the rails underneath and then roll into the small pit in front of you. Grab the ball on drop it down to the floor in the center. Now the two rails that cross over the large pit are too far apart for the receptacle ball to ride on them, so you will need to use Ultrahand to fuse it to the larger ball. Now pick up your fused balls and set them on the rails as far down as you can reach, as there is a pit at the end of the rails/chute that the balls can fall into if they have too much momentum (i.e., placing them onto the rails at the top), which causes them to reset to the center floor. Once they are safely sitting on the lower floor, paraglide down to them, and place the smaller ball into the receptacle to open the gate to the altar. Shrine Treasure Chest To get to the chest, right after getting the large ball for the first time, use Ultrahand to place the large ball in the center of the pit, spaced just right so that you can jump from the floor you are on, onto the top of the ball, and then onto the ledge with the chest. The chest contains a Large Zonai Charge. Video Walkthrough Gallery Use the Paraglider along with the wind to reach the higher platform. To the ledge, there is a cubby hole Link can reach. Use Ascend to get up to the large ball. Grab the ball with Ultrahand and place it half way towards the treasure chest. Jump over to the chest to get a Large Zonai Charge. Place the large ball so it sites where the opening narrows. Stand underneath the ball and use Ascend. Link will pop up outside the ball at a higher elevation. Use Recall on the ball when it is on the second ramp. Cancel recall when it is right above the rails. The ball will fall straight down onto the rails and roll towards Link. Attach the Orb with the larger ball with Ultrahand and place the large ball on the rails. The ball rolls very quickly, but Link can use Recall on it to slow it down. Pull the orb off, or just put the combined piece into the hole to open the door, where Link can then reach the altar.\", metadata={'source': './langchain_doc.csv', 'row': 124}),\n",

Contents Drifting Flame As you enter the first room, you'll see a closed gate with an unlit upside-down ancient torch suspended to the left of it, and a lit ancient torch with a normal Torch on the ground to the right of it. Ignoring the torch on the ground, pull out your bow and walk over to the lit torch so that it lights your arrow on fire, and then shoot it at the upside torch to light it, opening the gate. You can also just fuse a Fire Fruit or Red Chuchu Jelly to your arrow and shoot the upside-down torch to light it that way. Climb the ladder, and you'll see a button on the floor with a fence on three sides of it, a large open platform behind it with three columns suspended over it, and a walkway to it's right that leads to the final closed gate. There is also a lit ancient torch that you can pick up with Ultrahand on that walkway. Standing on the button causes the open platform to drop down a good ways (roughly 20ft/6m), but also causes upside-down ancient torches to come down out of the bottom of the three suspended columns. You need to light the torches to open the final gate. Option 1:\\nPick up the lit ancient torch off of the walkway, run onto the platform and directly through the center of each square of sand underneath the three columns, and then quickly run back to the button and put down the torch. Once you step on the button, quickly use Recall on the lit ancient torch. If done correctly, the torch should move back to each column, lighting the upside-down torches and opening the gate. If trying to get all three lit in one shot is too difficult, it is possible to do the torches one at a time, as once an upside-down torch is lit, it will stay lit, even when it is no longer exposed. Option 2:\\nGrab the lit ancient torch with Ultrahand, and bring the torch over to the button. Now, while standing on the button, pull the torch right next to you so that it's on top of the pressed button as well, and hold it there for roughly 20 seconds. Now release the torch and step off of the button. Now use Recall on the torch, and it should activate the button, dropping the platform and torches down. Now just use arrows fused with Fire Fruit or Red Chuchu Jelly to light the torches before Recall runs out. The lone chest of this shrine (which contains a Construct Bow whose level depends on your world level) is in an alcove directly underneath the button in the second room.

The Shrine is located in the Gerudo Highlands on Rutimala Hill. Contents A Route for a Ball Once inside of the shrine, move down the ramp and make a left, noticing the large ball receptacle and the closed gate to the altar as you do so. To your left will be a large pit, with a pair of rails on the right side, and a pair of angled fans pointing up to the ledge above. Paraglide up to the ledge using the fans. Once on the ledge, straight ahead there will be a small pit (with floor) with a treasure chest on a ledge past it, to your right will be a higher ledge with a funnel-shaped chimney built into the face of it, and to your left will be an alcove with another ledge above it, this one holding a large ball. Use Ascend in the alcove to get up to the ledge, then grab the ball using Ultrahand and bring it down to the floor. To get up to the higher ledge on the right, use Ultrahand to place the large ball into the funnel-shaped section of the chimney, then stand underneath it and use Ascend to get on top of the ball, and jump onto the ledge. Up here you'll see our receptacle ball stuck in an endless loop of rolling down chutes and falling into the abyss. Once the ball reaches the second chute, hit the ball with Recall, and once it is over the gap between the chutes, deactivate Recall, causing the ball to fall onto the rails underneath and then roll into the small pit in front of you. Grab the ball on drop it down to the floor in the center. Now the two rails that cross over the large pit are too far apart for the receptacle ball to ride on them, so you will need to use Ultrahand to fuse it to the larger ball. Now pick up your fused balls and set them on the rails as far down as you can reach, as there is a pit at the end of the rails/chute that the balls can fall into if they have too much momentum (i.e., placing them onto the rails at the top), which causes them to reset to the center floor. Once they are safely sitting on the lower floor, paraglide down to them, and place the smaller ball into the receptacle to open the gate to the altar. Shrine Treasure Chest To get to the chest, right after getting the large ball for the first time, use Ultrahand to place the large ball in the center of the pit, spaced just right so that you can jump from the floor you are on, onto the top of the ball, and then onto the ledge with the chest. The chest contains a Large Zonai Charge. Video Walkthrough Gallery Use the Paraglider along with the wind to reach the higher platform. To the ledge, there is a cubby hole Link can reach. Use Ascend to get up to the large ball. Grab the ball with Ultrahand and place it half way towards the treasure chest. Jump over to the chest to get a Large Zonai Charge. Place the large ball so it sites where the opening narrows. Stand underneath the ball and use Ascend. Link will pop up outside the ball at a higher elevation. Use Recall on the ball when it is on the second ramp. Cancel recall when it is right above the rails. The ball will fall straight down onto the rails and roll towards Link. Attach the Orb with the larger ball with Ultrahand and place the large ball on the rails. The ball rolls very quickly, but Link can use Recall on it to slow it down.
